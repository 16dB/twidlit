<h1>Preferences</h1>
Much of the way Twidlit looks and works can be tuned by editing the preference text files. 
These files are stored inside the <em>Twidlit.jar</em>, but you can access them by using <em>File > Preferences...</em> to choose a location to store them. 
Twidlit will copy any of the preference files not already there to that location and read them from there next time it starts.

<h2><tt>TwidlitKeyValues.txt</tt> and <tt>TwidlitKeyNames.txt</tt></h2>
Twidlit is set up to use the US keyboard mapping. 
If yours is different you can probably find it in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code">www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code</a> and change these files. 

<h2><tt>TwidlitUnprintable.txt</tt></h2>
Some ASCII values are unprintable (<em>backspace</em>, for example). 
When every keystroke needs to be visible the values in this file are treated specially.
