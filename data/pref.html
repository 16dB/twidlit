<h1>Preferences</h1>
Much of the way Twidlit looks and works can be tuned by editing the preference text files. 
They are stored in <em>Twidlit.jar</em>, but you can access them by using <em>File > Preferences...</em> to choose a location to store them. 
Twidlit will copy any of them not already there to that location, and will read them from there next time it starts.

<dt><tt>chord.pool.fraction 16</tt><br>
<dd>The fraction (1/x) of available chords in the sliding window from which the next chord is randomly chosen. 
A small value (eg 1) is undesirable as some chords will turn up more frequently than others. 
A large value (eg 255) makes chords appear in a fixed order.
<dt><tt>control.separation.size 10</tt><br>
<dd>The size of the separation between controls on the Twiddler Settings windows.
<dt><tt>count.repeats.max 2</tt><br>
<dd>When character frequency counting, any more are ignored after this many of the same one in a row.
<dt><tt>count.clear.confirm true</tt><br>
<dd>Whether to open a dialog to confirm you want to clear the character frequency counts.
<dt><tt>key.wait.msec 80</tt><br>
<dd>The milliseconds Twidlit waits for a further keystroke to arrive from the Twiddler before converting the accumulated keys into a chord.
<dt><tt>name.delimiter.start &lt</tt><br>
<dd>The character used to indicate the start of a key name, 
for example in <a href='#txt'><tt>TwidlitKeyNames.txt</tt></a>.
<dt><tt>name.delimiter.end &gt</tt><br>
<dd>The character used to indicate the end of a key name, 
for example in <a href='#txt'><tt>TwidlitKeyNames.txt</tt></a>.

<dd>The color of the thumb button labels in the Twiddler window.
<dt><tt>twiddler.mark.match.color yellow</tt><br>
<dd>The color used to mark a chord that matches the one highlighted.
<dt><tt>twiddler.mark.mismatch.color black</tt><br>
<dd>The color used to mark a chord that does not match the one highlighted.
<dt><tt>twiddler.progress.step.msec 150</tt><br>
<dd>The time in milliseconds between updates of the Twiddler window progress bar.
<dt><tt>twiddler.highlight.msec 2000</tt><br>
<dd>The milliseconds for which a chord is highlighted  in the Twiddler window. 
<dt><tt>twiddler.rehighlight.msec 4000</tt><br>
<dd>The milliseconds delay before a chord is highlighted again in the Twiddler window.
The progress bar duration is the sum of this and the highlight time.

<h2><tt>TwidlitKeyValues.txt</tt>, <tt>TwidlitKeyNames.txt</tt> and <tt>TwidlitKeyEvents.txt</tt></h2>
Twidlit is set up to use the US keyboard mapping. 
If yours is different you can probably find it in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code">www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code</a> and change these files. 
<h2><tt>TwidlitUnprintables.txt</tt></h2>
Some ASCII values are unprintable (<em>backspace</em>, for example). 
When every keystroke needs to be visible the values in this file are treated specially.
<h2><tt>TwidlitDuplicates.txt</tt></h2>
Some keys are duplicates (<em>Numpad4</em>, for example). 
You can configure your twiddler to generate them but they never appear in text.
<h2><tt>TwidlitLost.txt</tt></h2>
Some keystrokes never reach an application (<em>&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt/Alt&gt;</em>, for example). 
They vary with OS.
