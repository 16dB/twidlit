<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to create a new <tt>cfg.txt</tt> file that maps chords to characters.
<dt><b>Twiddler Settings...</b>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to modify the current configuration's Twiddler settings. These were used by Twiddler 2. I am not sure which ones affect Twiddler 3.
<dt><b>Preferences...</b>

<a name='windows'>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<a name='twiddler'>
<h2>Twiddler</h2>
The Twiddler window indicates the chord to press, while the progress bar to one side shows the elapsed time (up to six seconds). 
The chord is highlighted for two seconds or until pressed. 
If it isn't pressed it is highlighted again every six seconds. 
<br><br>
The six second cycle time can be adjusted via the menu, and the component times can be changed individually in the preferences. 
<br><br>
The window also marks any chord that is pressed, in yellow if it matches and black otherwise. 
Sometimes nothing appears when you thought you pressed a chord. 
This is the result of a miss-key. 
The Twiddler generates nothing if two or more buttons are pressed in the same row. 
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
If you like, you can map more than one chord to a keystroke.
You might choose to map a Shift-less finger cord to <em>A</em>, for example. 
<em>A</em> can then be generated by this chord or by the chord for <em>a</em> plus the <em>Shift</em> thumb button.
<br><br>
This is a problem for Twidlit because it does not know which chord was pressed when an <em>A</em> arrives. 
The Twiddler window always displays the chord with the least number of thumb buttons.
If there is still ambiguity it displays the chord with the least number of finger buttons.

<a name='help'>
<h2>Help</h2>
The help text contains a few hypertext links. 
Navigation buttons (back and forwards) appear at the top of the Help window if you follow an internal link. 

<a name='stw'>
<h2>Save Text</h2>
This window displays text that can be selected and copied, or saved. 
Editing is not supported. 
<br><br>
You can use the <em>Save As...</em> button to save the contents. 
If it contains chord mappings the dialog allows you to save it as <tt>cfg.txt</tt> or <tt>cfg</tt>. 

<a name='chord'>
<h1>Chords</h1>
Here are a few chord statistics: 
<table style="width:100%">
  <tr>
    <td>One button chords</td>
    <td>12</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Two buttons chords</td>
    <td>54</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Three buttons chords</td>
    <td>108</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Four buttons chords</td>
    <td>81</td> 
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Total chords</td>
    <td>255</td> 
  </tr>
</table>
<a name='cfg'>
<h1>Chord files</h1>
Chord mapping files come in two flavours, <tt>cfg</tt> (binary) and <tt>cfg.txt</tt> (text). 
The Twiddler can only read <tt>cfg</tt>s, and you and I can only read <tt>cfg.txt</tt>s. 
Happily Twidlit can read and write both.
<br><br>
I get confused trying to manage binary files that have to be given the same name (<tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>) when in use, 
so I keep my config files as text and only save them as binary when loading the Twiddler. 
<br><br>
The <em>Files of type</em> selector below the file name box on the <em>Open</em> and <em>Save As</em> dialogs allows you to choose the type of file you want. 
No other extension can be used so you do not need to type the extension on the file name, it will be added if not present. 

<a name='4finger'>
<h1>4finger syntax</h1>
Four-character tags represent chords, starting with the index finger. 
For example <b><tt>|-,'</tt></b> 
<p>
<b><tt>|</tt></b> (pipe) is an inactive finger,<br>
<b><tt>-</tt></b> (hyphen) is the middle button,<br> 
<b><tt>,</tt></b> (comma) is the button below and<br> 
<b><tt>'</tt></b> (apostrophe) is the button above.<br>

<a name='pref'>
<h1>Preferences</h1>
Much of the way Twidlit looks and works can be tuned by editing the preference text files. 
They are stored in <em>Twidlit.jar</em>, but you can access them by using <em>File > Preferences...</em> to choose a location to store them. 
Twidlit will copy any of them not already there to that location, and will read them from there next time it starts. 
Just delete any you don't edit.

A large value (eg 255) makes chords appear in a fixed order.

The progress bar duration is the sum of this and the highlight time.

<a name='key.txt'>
<h2><tt>TwidlitKeyValues.txt</tt>, <tt>TwidlitKeyNames.txt</tt> and <tt>TwidlitKeyEvents.txt</tt></h2>
Twidlit is set up to use the US keyboard mapping. 
If yours is different you can probably find it in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code">www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code</a> and change these files. 
<a name='unprint.txt'>
<h2><tt>TwidlitUnprintables.txt</tt></h2>
Some ASCII values are unprintable (<em>backspace</em>, for example). 
When every keystroke needs to be visible the values in this file are treated specially.
<a name='dup.txt'>
<h2><tt>TwidlitDuplicates.txt</tt></h2>
Some keys are duplicates (<em>Numpad4</em>, for example). 
You can configure your twiddler to generate them but they never appear in text.
<a name='lost.txt'>
<h2><tt>TwidlitLost.txt</tt></h2>
Some keystrokes never reach an application (<em>&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt/Alt&gt;</em>, for example). 
They vary with OS.
