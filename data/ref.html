<h1>The Help window</h1>
The help text contains a few hypertext links. 
Navigation buttons (back and forwards) appear at the top of the Help window if you follow an internal link. 

<h1>The Twiddler window</h1>
The Twiddler window indicates the chord to press, while the progress bar to one side shows the elapsed time (up to six seconds). 
The chord is highlighted for two seconds or until pressed. 
If it isn't pressed it is highlighted again every six seconds. 
<br><br>
The six second cycle time can be adjusted via the menu, and the component times can be changed individually in the preferences. 
<br><br>
The window also marks any chord that is pressed, in yellow if it matches and black otherwise. 
Sometimes nothing appears when you thought you pressed a chord. 
This is the result of a miss-key. 
The Twiddler generates nothing if two or more buttons are pressed in the same row. 
<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
If you like, you can map more than one chord to a keystroke.
You might choose to map a Shift-less finger cord to <em>A</em>, for example. 
<em>A</em> can then be generated by this chord or by the chord for <em>a</em> plus the <em>Shift</em> thumb button.
<br><br>
This is a problem for Twidlit because it does not know which chord was pressed when an <em>A</em> arrives. 
The Twiddler window always displays the chord with the least number of thumb buttons.
If there is still ambiguity it displays the chord with the least number of finger buttons.

<h1>Menus</h1>
<h2>File</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Open...</b>
<dd>Discards the current Twiddler configuration (if any) and uses the selected <a href='#cfg'><tt>cfg.txt</tt> or <tt>cfg</tt> file</a>. 
<dt><b>View & Save</b>
<dd><dl>
<dt><b>Chords</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> showing the current chord mapping. 
<dt><b>Chords Reversed</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> showing the current chord mapping with reversed chords. You might want to experiment with this for chording with your other hand. 
<dt><b>Chord List</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> showing a list of every unmodified chord with a one keystroke mapping. 
This is the default mapping, and is ideal for chording practice and timing. 
<dt><b>Chords By Time</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> showing a list of every unmodified chord with (and sorted by) the median time taken to press it. 
Initially these times are all zero.
</dl>
<dt><b>Twiddler Settings...</b>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to modify the current configuration's Twiddler settings. These were used by Twiddler 2. I am not sure which ones affect Twiddler 3.
<dt><b>Preferences...</b>
<dd>Allows you to select a location for the <a href="pref.html">preference</a> text files. 
</dl>

<h2>Counts</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Include Bigrams</b>
<dd> Whether to count bigrams (pairs of characters).
<dt><b>Include Ngrams</b>
<dd> Whether to count the ngrams (sequences of characters) listed in <tt>TwidlitNGrams.txt</tt>.
<dt><b>Count File...</b>
<dd>Allows you to select a file and add its character counts to the stored totals. 
<dt><b>Count Files...</b>
<dd>Allows you to select a folder and add the character counts of all contained files to the stored counts. 
<dt><b>Set Range Displayed...</b>
<dd>Opens a dialog where you can set the range of character frequencies displayed as table or graph.
<dt><b>Table Counts</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> displaying the character frequencies as a table. 
The columns are ASCII, value, count and percent. 
<dt><b>Graph Counts</b>
<dd>Opens a <a href='#stw'>Save Text window</a> displaying the character frequencies as a graph. 
This is a simple text graph just to give a better indication of the relative magnitudes. 
<dt><b>Clear Counts</b>
<dd>Clears the counts to zero.
</dl>

<h2>Tutor</h2>
<dl>
<dt><b>Timed</b>
<dd>Whether your chording (for the current hand) is timed.
<dt><b>Clear Times</b>
<dd>Clears the chording times for the current hand.
<dt><b>Speed...</b>
<dd>Opens a dialog that allows you to adjust the time the Twiddler window waits for a chord to be pressed.
<dt><b>Show Twiddler</b>
<dd>Whether the Twiddler window is visible.
<dt><b>Highlight Expected Chord</b>
<dd>Whether the Twiddler window highlights the expected chord.
<dt><b>Mark Chord Pressed</b>
<dd>Whether the Twiddler window marks the chord that has just been pressed. 
<dt><b>Left/Right Hand</b>
<dd>Sets the hand being used to twiddle. Hands are timed separately. (The progress bar will appear on the opposite side.)
</dl>

<a name='cfg'>
<h1><tt>cfg</tt> and <tt>cfg.txt</tt> files</h1>
Configuration files come in two flavours, <tt>cfg</tt> (binary) and <tt>cfg.txt</tt> (text). 
The Twiddler can only read <tt>cfg</tt>s, and you and I can only read <tt>cfg.txt</tt>s. 
Happily Twidlit can read and write both.
<br><br>
I get confused trying to manage binary files that have to be given the same name (<tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>) when in use, 
so I keep my config files as text and only save them as binary when loading the Twiddler. 
<br><br>
The <em>Files of type</em> selector below the file name box on the <em>Open</em> and <em>Save As</em> dialogs allows you to choose the type of file you want. 
No other extension can be used so you do not need to type the extension on the file name, it will be added if not present. 

<a name='stw'>
<h1>Save Text window</h1>
This window displays text that can be selected and copied, or saved to a file using the <em>Save As...</em> button in the bottom right corner. 
Editing is not supported.

<a name='4finger'>
<h1>4finger syntax</h1>
Four-character tags represent chords, starting with the index finger. 
For example <b><tt>|-,'</tt></b> 
<p>
<b><tt>|</tt></b> (pipe) is an inactive finger,<br>
<b><tt>-</tt></b> (hyphen) is the middle button,<br> 
<b><tt>,</tt></b> (comma) is the button below and<br> 
<b><tt>'</tt></b> (apostrophe) is the button above.<br>
