<a name='dialogs'>
<h1>Dialogs</h1>
<a name='map'>
<h2>Map Chords</h2>
This dialog allows you to create a new <a href="syn.html#cfg"><tt>cfg.chords</tt></a> file.
<br><br>
Select a <a href="syn.html#chords"><tt>chords</tt></a> file and a <a href="syn.html#keys"><tt>keys</tt></a> file and click <em>OK</em>. 
Twidlit combines each chord from the <tt>chords</tt> file with the corresponding keystroke from the <tt>keys</tt> file to generate a mapping. 
If the selected files are <a href="syn.html#timed"><tt>timed.chords</tt></a> and <a href="syn.html#ccount"><tt>count.keys</tt></a> then you have matched your fastest chords with your most frequent characters. 
<br><br>
You can also specify a <tt>cfg.chords</tt> file of mappings you wish to preserve. 
These mappings are added to the output as-is, and the corresponding chords in the <tt>chords</tt> file are ignored. 
If you use a file of your chosen mnemonic mappings for less-used keystrokes then the result will be the combination of these with a fastest to most frequent mapping.  
<a name='countsrange'>
<h2>Range of Counts Displayed</h2>
This dialog adjusts the range of character frequencies displayed as a table or a graph. 
It is particularly useful with graphs to improve the resolution. 

<a name='speed'>
<h2>Chord Wait</h2>
This dialog adjusts the time Twidlit <a href="#wait">waits</a> for a chord to be pressed. 

<a name='delay'>
<h2>Chord Delay</h2>
This dialog adjusts the time between a keystroke being highlighted in the <a href='#text'>Text pane</a> and the chord being displayed in the <a href='#twiddler'>Twiddler window</a>. 

<a name='windows'>
<h1>Windows</h1>
<a name='twiddler'>
<h2>Twiddler</h2>
<a name="orient">
<h3>Orientation</h3>
The Twiddler window can be oriented <a href='#tutor'>horizontally or vertically</a>. 
You might think it a no-brainer that you want it vertical, but think again. 
As long as you are working with chords written as text you will be thinking of them going left to right, index to little finger. 
Why make it harder for yourself by having to rotate them to vertical?
<br><br>
If it offends you to hold the Twiddler horizontally, just do your gangsta act and it will come naturally.

<h3>Chords</h3>
The Twiddler window highlights the chord to press. 
It also marks any chord that is pressed, in yellow if it matches and black otherwise. 
<br><br>
Sometimes nothing appears when you thought you pressed a chord. 
This is the result of a miss-key: the Twiddler generates nothing if two or more buttons are pressed in the same row. 

<a name="wait">
<h3>Timing</h3>
There are three timing progress bars running alongside the Twiddler display. 
A fourth bar runs crosswise at their base and indicates the number of samples of each chord collected so far (up to the <a href='#preferences'><tt>chord.times.stored</tt></a>). 
<br><br>
The timing bars' extent is the <em>chord wait</em>. 
The dashed lines between the bars mark out the seconds. 
The outer-most bar shows the mean of the mean times of all the chords, the middle bar shows the mean time for the current chord, and the inner-most (timer) bar shows the elapsed time.
<br><br>
If the elapsed time exceeds the chord wait, the timer bar goes red for up to the chord wait, and then blank. 
If the bar is blank the chord's time is ignored. 
<br><br>
Twidlit only attempts to record the time of a chord if it takes less than twice the chord wait.
This allows you to just stop at any time. 
Timing restarts with the next chord, and the chord that went untimed will be repeated soon. 
<br><br>
The chord wait can be adjusted using <em><a href="#tutor">Tutor<a> > Set Chord Wait...</em>, or simply left to auto-scale. 
It comprises the following: 
<dl>
<dt><b>Delay</b>
<dd>
The delay is not used when random chording. 
It is the length of time after a keystroke is highlighted in the <a href='#text'>Text pane</a> before its chord is highlighted in the Twiddler window. 
It can be adjusted using <em><a href="#tutor">Tutor<a> > Set Chord Delay...</em> 
<dt><b>Highlight time</b>
<dd>
The highlight time is the time a chord is highlighted in the Twiddler window. 
<dt><b>Hide time</b>
<dd>
The hide time is the remaining chord wait, when the chord is not visible. 
</dl>
The relationships between the times can be adjusted using the <a href='#pref'>Preferences</a>.

<h3>Ambiguity</h3>
If you like, you can map more than one chord to a keystroke.
You might choose to map a thumb-less cord to <em>A</em>, for example. 
<em>A</em> can then be generated by this chord or by the chord for <em>a</em> plus the <em>Shift</em> thumb button.
<br><br>
This is a problem for Twidlit because it does not know which chord was pressed when an <em>A</em> arrives. 
The Twiddler window always displays the chord with the least number of thumb buttons.
If there is still ambiguity it displays the chord with the least number of finger buttons.

<a name='text'>
<h2>Text pane</h2>
The Text pane is in the main window, underneath the menu bar. 
It displays the upcoming keystrokes with the current keystroke highlighted. 
It remains blank if <em><a href="#chords">Tutor > Chords<a></em> is checked. 

<a name='help'>
<h2>Help</h2>
Navigation buttons (back and forwards) appear at the top of the Help window if you follow an internal link. 

<a name='stw'>
<h2>Save Text</h2>
The Save Text window displays text that can be selected, copied or saved. 
Editing is not supported. 
<br><br>
You can use the <em>Save As...</em> button to save the contents. 
If it contains chord mappings, the save dialog allows you to save it as <tt>cfg.chords</tt> or <tt>cfg</tt>. 
If it contains chords, the <em>As 0MRL</em> button allows you to convert them to 0MRL format.

<a name='pref'>
<h1>Preferences</h1>
Much of the way Twidlit looks and works can be tuned by editing the preference text files. 
You may need to edit one or more if you use interesting characters or an OS other than Windows. 
<br><br>
The files are stored in <em>Twidlit.jar</em>, but you can access them by using <em>File > Preferences...</em> to choose a location to store them. 
Twidlit will copy any of them not already there to that location, and will read them from there next time it starts. 
Just delete any that you don't edit, or that you want to revert to the defaults.
The syntax is described <a href='syn.html#types'>here<a>.

<h2><tt>twidlit.value.keys</tt>, <tt>twidlit.name.keys</tt> and <tt>twidlit.event.keys</tt></h2>
Twidlit is set up to use the US keyboard mapping. 
If yours is different you can probably find it in <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code">www.w3.org/TR/DOM-Level-3-Events-code</a> and change these files. 
<h2><tt>twidlit.unprintable.keys</tt></h2>
Some ASCII values are unprintable (<tt>Backspace</tt>, for example). 
When every keystroke needs to be visible the values in this file are treated specially.
<h2><tt>twidlit.duplicate.keys</tt></h2>
Some keys are duplicates (<tt>Numpad4</tt>, for example). 
You can configure your Twiddler to generate them but they never appear in text.
<h2><tt>twidlit.lost.keys</tt></h2>
Some keystrokes never reach an application (<em>&lt;Alt&gt;&lt;Tab&gt;&lt/Alt&gt;</em>, for example). 
They vary with OS, Twidlit comes set up for Windows.
