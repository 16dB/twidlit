<title>Introducing Twidlit</title>
<center><h1>Introducing Twidlit, a twiddler's companion</h1></center>
The Twiddler promises to set you free from the workstation. 
No more sitting (or standing) up against a table with both hands fully occupied. 
It will also free you from the mobile way, which covers half of your precious little screen with a replica keyboard and demands most of your attention to peck the tiny keys. 
<br><br>
So why isn't everyone twiddling? 
<br><br>
You are going to have to commit a significant amount of time upfront to learning and practice. 
What's more, there will be no transitional hunt and peck period when you are slow but effective. 
With the Twiddler it's touch-type or nothing - but Twidlit is here to help. 

<h2>The chord image</h2>
Do you know where the 'G' key is on a conventional keyboard? 
How about 'o'? 
Even if you do, would you use that knowledge when typing? 
Of course not, there isn't time. 
You just think "Go" and your fingers know. 
<br><br>
This is fluency. 
It relies on an unconscious image of the keyboard that your fingers are utterly familiar with. 
To twiddle fluently you will need an equivalent image of the chords. 
<br><br>
However, the Twiddler's twelve finger buttons enable <a href='ref.html#stats'>255</a> chords, well over twice the number of keys on a conventional keyboard. 
Your brain needs all the help it can get in indentifying and distinguishing chords in your image. 
<br><br>
By presenting chords visually, Twidlit adds a powerful visual dimension to your cognition. 
This happens in the initial familiarization phase, priming your brain to learn quickly once you decide on a mapping of chords to keystrokes. 

<h2>Don't look down</h2>
If you try to look at the buttons while you are chording you will find it extremely awkward. 
You have to twist your wrist uncomfortably and then your fingers get in the way. 
Also, by turning the Twiddler round to face you, you have reversed the horizontal positions of the buttons. 
This confuses your chord image. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, all the Twiddler documentation, and the <em>0MRL</em> syntax it uses, assume that you have the Twiddler reversed in this way. 
Even the new mouse buttons (which are unmappable) are reversed. 
<br><br>
Twidlit does not work that way. 
The <a href='ref.html#twiddler'>Twiddler window</a> shows the finger buttons in their tactile locations -- as if the Twiddler is transparent and you can see the backs of the buttons. 
Twidlit does not use <em>0MRL</em> either (though it can read it), instead it uses a syntax called <a href='syn.html#chord'><em>4finger</em></a>.
