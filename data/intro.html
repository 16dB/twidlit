<h1>Introducing Twidlit, the twiddler's companion</h1>
</center>
The Twiddler promises to set you free from the workstation. 
No more sitting (or standing) up against a table with both hands fully occupied. 
It will also free you from the mobile way, which covers half of your precious little screen with a replica keyboard that demands most of your attention to peck the tiny keys. 
<br><br>
So why isn't everyone twiddling? 
<br><br>
You are going to have to commit a significant amount of your time upfront to learning and practice. 
What's more, there will be no transitional hunt and peck period when you are slow but effective. 
With the Twiddler it's touch-type or nothing - but Twidlit is here to help. 
<br><br>
Until you are fluent, your Twiddler is just a cute toy. 
Twidlit focusses on chording fast, and soon. 
There is so much to do, most of it practice, but what should you be practising? 
Choosing a chord mapping is a serious commitment. 
<br><br>
The best argument I have seen for the Twiddler's default mapping is that it makes no difference what mapping you use. 
I am not convinced, it sounds like sour grapes to me. 
No one who has once committed to a mapping is going to be interested in improvements. 
Have you considered moving on from Qwerty to Dvorak? Seriously? 
<br><br>
Unlike a conventional keyboard the Twiddler is personal. 
There is no benefit to you in using the same mapping as anyone else, and 
Twidlit has the tools for you to develop the mapping that best suits you. 

<h2>Mapping chords to key-strokes</h2>
Do you know where the 'G' key is on a keyboard? 
How about 'o'? 
Even if you do, would you use that knowledge when typing? 
Of course not, there isn't time. 
You just think "Go" and your fingers know. 
<br><br>
Twidlit teaches your fingers, bypassing conscious memory, and 
once you forget about memorization, defining the chord mappings becomes easy. 
There is only one rule: <em>the faster the chord the more frequent its key-stroke</em>. 
And both chord speed and key-stroke frequency can be measured. 

<h4>Speed</h4>
With Twidlit you can get started making your fingers fluent before deciding on a chord mapping. 
You start practicing by pressing the random chords it shows you, and when you are ready it times you and report your averages. 

<h4>Frequency</h4>
If you write emails or computer code then your Sent folder or source tree contains a record of your (printable) key-strokes. 
Even if you write formatted documents they can be saved as text. 
Twidlit's <em>Counts</em> facility allows you to table and graph the relative frequencies of characters from multiple ASCII text files. 

<h4>A map of your own</h4>
By matching your chord speeds with your character frequencies you can develop a personalized, evidence-based mapping. 
<br><br>
To be honest it isn't really quite that simple. 
What about the cursor keys, for example? 
Also, some key-strokes are so rare that, long-term, your fingers may not get enough practice to remember them. 
You will want to tweak your mapping to include unprintable keys, and maybe arrange rare key-strokes memorably as well, but still, the bulk of the job is done. 

<h2>Don't look down</h2>
Face the screen and hold your Twiddler comfortably as you would like to use it. 
Are you looking at the buttons? I hope not. 
<br><br>
One of the virtues of the Twiddler is that it allows you to devote all your visual attention to the screen. 
This does not mean that you do not have a mental image of where the buttons are, only that your fingers (not your eyes) deliver it to your brain. 
<br><br>
Your tactile image of the button locations is one of the most important tools you have for learning, but it takes a while to develop. 
With the Twiddler in your hand, feel the positions of all the buttons with your fingers. 
If you carry your Twiddler about with you, you can practice this anytime. 
No one will notice and over time your fingers will soak up the knowledge. 
<br><br>
Put your fingers on the column of buttons closest to your thumb.  
With your arm comfortably straight, if you are using your left hand, then these will be to the right. 
Now turn the Twiddler round so you can look at the buttons. 
Not only is this awkward and uncomfortable, the column your fingers are on is now to the left! 
<br><br>
This confusing reversal means that looking at the buttons undermines the development of your tactile image. 
Unfortunately, all the Twiddler documentation and the <em>0MRL</em> syntax it uses assume that you are looking at the Twiddler buttons. 
<br><br>
Twidlit does not work that way. 
It's Twiddler window shows the buttons in their tactile locations -- as if the Twiddler were transparent and you can see the backs of the buttons through it.
Twidlit does not use <em>0MRL</em> either (though it can read it) instead it uses a syntax called <em>4finger</em>. 
<br><br>
Like <em>0MRL</em>, <em>4finger</em> uses one character for each finger, starting with the index finger, but the characters are different. 
For example, <b><tt>0MRL</tt></b> is written <b><tt>|-,'</tt></b> 
It's easy to read because the text maps directly to your tactile image without involving the abstract concept of left and right at all.
