<h1>Introducing Twidlit, the Twiddler's companion</h1></center>
The Twiddler promises to set you free from the workstation. 
No more sitting (or standing) up against a table with both hands fully occupied. 
It will also free you from the mobile way, which covers half of your precious little screen with a replica keyboard that demands most of your attention to peck the tiny keys. 
<br><br>
So why isn't everyone twiddling? 
<br><br>
You are going to have to commit a significant amount of your time upfront to learning and practice. 
What's more, there will be no transitional hunt and peck period when you are slow but effective. 
With the Twiddler it's touch-type or nothing - but Twidlit is here to help. 
<br><br>
Until you are fluent, your Twiddler is just a cute toy.
Twidlit focusses on chording fast soon.
There is so much to do, most of it practice, but what should you be practising?
Choosing a chord mapping is a serious commitment. 

<h2>Mapping</h2>
Do you know where the 'G' key is on a keyboard? 
How about 'o'? 
Even if you do, would you use that knowledge when typing? 
Of course not, there isn't time. 
You just think "Go" and your fingers know. 
<br><br>
Twidlit teaches your fingers, bypassing memory. 
Once you forget about memorization, defining the chord mappings becomes easy. 
There is only one rule: <em>the faster the chord the more frequent its key-stroke</em>.
And both speed and frequency can be measured.

<h4>Speed</h4>
With Twidlit there is no need for a chord mapping to get started making your fingers fluent. 
You practice pressing the random chords it shows and when you are ready Twidlit will time you and report your averages.

<h4>Frequency</h4>
If you write emails or computer code then your Sent folder or source tree contains a record of your (printable) key-strokes. 
Even if you write formatted documents they can probably be saved as text. 
Twidlit's <em>Counts</em> facility allows you to table and graph the relative frequencies of characters from multiple ASCII text files. 

<h4>A map of your own</h4>
You are not going to use someone else's Twiddler so why would you use their chord mapping? 
By matching your chord speeds with your character frequencies you can develop a personalized and evidence-based mapping. 
<br><br>
This is not a hard and fast system, for example it does not take account of unprintable characters. 
Also, some characters are so rare that long-term your fingers may not get enough practice to remember them. 
Thus you will want to tweak your mapping to include unprintables, and maybe to place rare key-strokes memorably as well, but the bulk of the job is done. 
Twidlit includes tools to assist with matching up ordered lists of chords and key-strokes into <em>cfg</em> files.

<h2>Don't look down</h2>
Face the screen and hold your Twiddler comfortably as you would like to use it. 
Are you looking at the buttons? I hope not. 
<br><br>
One of the virtues of the Twiddler is that it allows you to devote 100% of your visual attention to the screen. 
This does not mean that you do not have a mental image of where the buttons are, only that your fingers (not your eyes) deliver it to your brain. 
<br><br>
Your tactile image of the button locations is one of the most important tools you have for learning, but it takes a while to develop. 
With the Twiddler in your hand, feel the positions of all the buttons with your fingers. 
If you carry your Twiddler about with you, you can practice this anytime. 
No one will notice and your fingers will soak up the knowledge. 
<br><br>
Put your fingers on the column of buttons closest to your thumb.  
With your arm comfortably straight, if you are using your left hand, then these will be to the right. 
Now turn the Twiddler round so you can look at the buttons.  
Not only is this awkward and uncomfortable, the column your fingers are on is now to the left! 
<br><br>
This confusing reversal means that looking at the buttons undermines the development of your tactile image. 
Unfortunately, all the Twiddler documentation and the <em>0MRL</em> syntax assume that you are looking at the Twiddler buttons. 
<br><br>
Twidlit does not work that way. 
It's Twiddler window shows the buttons in their tactile locations. 
Twidlit does not use <em>0MRL</em> either, though it can read it, 
instead it uses a syntax called <em>4finger</em>. 
<br><br>
Like <em>0MRL</em>, <em>4finger</em> uses one character for each finger, starting with the index finger, but the characters are different. 
For example, <b><tt>0MRL</tt></b> is written <b><tt>|-,'</tt></b>.  
It's easy to read because the text maps directly to your tactile image without involving the abstract concept of left and right at all.
