You can use Twidlit in any way that makes sense to you, but it was developed to support the following sequence of activities.

<h2>Getting fluent</h2>
When I first held my Twiddler it felt really awkward, there were so many buttons my fingers had trouble telling one from another. 
The first step was to get my fingers familiar with the buttons, and to do that I didn't even need to turn it on. 
<br><br>
<em>Air twiddling</em> is chording with a dead Twiddler, and it's the secret to getting going quickly. 
You can do it any time and almost anywhere, it's amazing what you can do with a Twiddler strapped to your palm. 
Riding a bike is awkward, but driving is fine. 
<br><br>
With air twiddling, your fingers get the hang of it pretty fast, and you can start really pushing your chording fluency with Twidlit.

<h2>Timing all chords</h2>
<a name='setup'>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
The Twiddler uses a file of chord mappings (<tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>) to tell it what keystrokes to send for each chord. 
Twidlit needs to have the same mappings so it can convert incoming keystrokes back to chords for the display. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Twiddler's factory-default mapping only includes about 75 chords (without thumb keys). 
With its 12 finger buttons, the Twiddler has 255 chords and to practice them all you're going to need a different file. 
<br><br>
Plug in your Twiddler and use <a href="ref.html#saveas"><em>File > Save As...</em></a> to save Twidlit's complete mapping to your Twiddler as <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>. 
(<em>You will need to set </em>Files of type<em> to </em>cfg files<em>. 
You can rename the factory-supplied <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt> in the save dialog if you want to keep it.</em>)
<br><br>
Twidlit comes set up with a complete mapping by default. 
If it has been changed for some reason you may not have all chords covered. 
<em>File > Save As...</em> displays the mapping, if not all chords are there use <a href="ref.html#allchords"><em>File > All Chords...</em></a> to reinstall the complete mapping. 

<h3>Which hand?</h3>
It is good to leave your dominant hand free for other things, but the hand you use needs to be effective. 
Quite minor stiffness can cut your speed.
Twidlit allows you to post-pone the decision till you are ready. 
<br><br>
Use <em><a href="ref.html#tutor">Tutor</a> > Left/Right Hand</em> to select the hand you are using. 
The times will be kept separate and the progress bars on the <a href="ref.html#twiddler">Twiddler Window</a> flip to the side away from your palm. 
<br><br>
The Twiddler window reinforced the tactile image my fingers were learning and helped me visualize chords. 

<a name='count'>
<h2>Counting characters</h2>
<br><br>

<a name='map'>
<h2>Mapping chords</h2>
Twidlit has the tools to order chords by speed and characters by frequency, and to save them to configuration and counts files (<em>Tutor > List Chords By Time</em> and <em>Counts > Table Counts</em>). 
Twidlit also allows you to combine the two into a configuration file (<tt>cfg.txt</tt>). 
<br><br>
<em>File > Map Chords...</em> opens a dialog where you can select a configuration file and a counts file to combine.  
Twidlit ignores everything after the chords in the configuration file and everything after the characters in the counts file, 
and matches up each chord with the corresponding character. 
<br><br>
You can also specify a <em>cfg</em> file of mappings you wish to conserve. 
These mappings are added to the output as-is, and the corresponding chords in the chords file are omitted.
