<h1>Air Twiddling</h1>
When I first held my Twiddler it felt really awkward, there were so many buttons my fingers had trouble telling one from another. 
The first step was to make my fingers familiar with the buttons, and to do that I didn't even need to turn it on. 
<br><br>
<em>Air twiddling</em> is chording with a dead Twiddler, and it's the secret to getting going quickly. 
You can do it anytime and almost anywhere (it's amazing what you can do with a Twiddler strapped to your palm). 
I don't recommend riding a bike, but driving is fine. 
With air twiddling your fingers get the hang of it pretty fast and you can usefully start random chording with Twidlit. 

<a name='setup'>
<h1>Setting up Twidlit</h1>
The Twiddler uses a file (<tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>) to tell it what keystrokes to send for each chord. 
Twidlit needs to have the same chord mappings so that it can convert incoming keystrokes to chords for display. 
You might think it is a simple matter of reading the Twiddler's chord mapping file, but it turns out that the factory default file only maps about 75 bare chords and we need to practice them all. 
<br><br>
Save the factory supplied <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt> if you want it, and use <a href="ref.html#saveas"><em>File > Save As...</em></a> to save Twidlit's complete chord list to the Twiddler as <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt> file.

The Twiddler window reinforced the tactile image my fingers were learning and helped me visualize chords.

<h1>Mapping chords</h1>
Twidlit has the tools to order chords by speed and characters by frequency, and to save them to configuration and counts files (<em>Tutor > List Chords By Time</em> and <em>Counts > Table Counts</em>). 
Twidlit also allows you to combine the two into a configuration file (<tt>cfg.txt</tt>). 
<br><br>
<em>File > Map Chords...</em> opens a dialog where you can select a configuration file and a counts file to combine.  
Twidlit ignores everything after the chords in the configuration file and everything after the characters in the counts file, 
and matches up each chord with the corresponding character. 
<br><br>
You can also specify a <em>cfg</em> file of mappings you wish to conserve. 
These mappings are added to the output as-is, and the corresponding chords in the chords file are omitted.
