<h2>Getting familiar</h2>
<h3>Air twiddling</h3>
When I first held my Twiddler it felt really awkward, there were so many buttons my fingers had trouble telling one from another. 
The first step was to get my fingers familiar with the buttons, and to do that I didn't even need to turn it on. 
<br><br>
<em>Air twiddling</em> is chording with a dead Twiddler, and it's the secret to getting going quickly. 
You can do it any time and almost anywhere. 
It's amazing what you can do with a Twiddler strapped to your palm. 
Riding a bike is awkward, but driving is fine. 
<br><br>
With air twiddling, your fingers get the hang of it pretty fast, and you can start really pushing your chording fluency with Twidlit. 

<h3>Playing scales</h3>
If your Twiddler were a musical instrument you would expect to start out spending a lot of time playing scales. 
<em>Random chording</em> is Twiddler scales. 
You are not making music yet, but you are getting a feel for the chords: what's easy and what's hard, which side is which, and just how hard is it to coordinate three or four fingers?   
<br><br>
Meanwhile, Twidlit keeps track of how long each chord takes. 
Don't worry if you are very slow or erratic to start with, it won't affect your times long-term.

<h2>Random chording</h2>
<a name='time'>
<h3>Timing all chords</h3>
There are <a href='ref.html#stats'>255</a> thumb-less chords. 
That's more than a whole keyboard's worth, with and without the Shift key pressed. 
A few are too awkward for frequent use, but there are enough left that once you are practiced with all of them you may choose to ignore some of the thumb-keys. 
<br><br>
You need to find out for yourself which ones you are quick with and which are unmanageable, so random chording tests them all. 
<a name='setup'>
<h3>Initial setup</h3>
The Twiddler uses a file of chord mappings (<tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>) to tell it what keystrokes to send for each chord. 
Twidlit needs to have the same mappings so it can convert incoming keystrokes back to chords for the display. 
<br><br>
Unfortunately, the Twiddler's factory-default mapping only includes about 75 thumb-less chords. 
To practice all of them you're going to need a different map file. 
<br><br>
Twidlit comes set up with a complete mapping by default. 
If it has been changed you may not have all chords covered. 
In that case, <a href="ref.html#allchords"><em>File > Map All Chords...</em></a> will be enabled. 
Use it to reinstall the complete mapping before saving to the Twiddler. 
<br><br>
Plug in your Twiddler and use <a href="ref.html#saveascfg"><em>File > Save As CFG...</em></a> to save Twidlit's current mapping to your Twiddler as <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt>. 
If you want to keep the factory-supplied <tt>twiddler.cfg</tt> you can rename it in the save dialog. 

<h3>Which hand?</h3>
It is good to leave your dominant hand free for other things, but it's up to you. 
Maybe you want to be ambidextrous. 
Twidlit allows you to practice both hands and postpone the decision till you are ready. 
Separate times are kept for each hand. 
<br><br>
Use <em><a href="ref.html#tutor">Tutor</a> > Left/Right Hand</em> to specify the hand you are using. 
The progress bars on the <a href="ref.html#twiddler">Twiddler window</a> flip to the side away from your palm. 

<h3>Practice</h3>
Get as much practice as you can. 
Remember you don't need your brain for this.
As with air twiddling, keep trying to find activities you can do at the same time (such as watching movies). 
<br><br>
Twidlit keeps track of the last 16 presses of every chord and you can view them, or save them to a <a href="syn.html#timed">timed.chords</a> file, using <em><a href="ref.html#timelist">Tutor > List Chords by Time.</a></em> 
You can use the file to generate a mapping. 

<a name='map'>
<h2>Mapping chords</h2>
Unlike a conventional keyboard, the Twiddler is personal. 
There is no benefit to using the same mapping of chords to keystrokes as anyone else. 
Twidlit has the tools for you to develop the mapping that best suits you. 
<br><br>
There are two conflicting imperatives in the design of a chord mapping. 
First and foremost is the simple rule: <em>the more frequently a keystroke is used, the faster its chord should be</em>, 
and both keystroke frequency and chord speed can be measured. 

<h3>Fast and frequent</h3>
<a href="http://norvig.com/mayzner.html">http://norvig.com/mayzner.html</a> is the best resource I've seen for generic alphabetic character frequencies, 
but if you write code or just want to get a handle on punctuation frequencies then you need Twidlit's <a href="ref.html#counts"><em>Counts</em></a> facility to count your characters. 
<br><br>
Emails, source code, even formatted documents saved as text, all contain a record of your (printable) keystrokes, and can be analyzed. 
Twidlit can save a <tt><a href='syn.html#ccount'>count.keys</a></tt> file of keystrokes sorted by frequency that you can use to generate a mapping.
<br><br>
This is not a complete solution, there are plenty of keystrokes (such as the cursor keys) that don't leave a record. 
It can get things into proportion though, and I have found it invaluable for analyzing source code. 

<h3>Mnemonic structure</h3>
Long-term, the less common keystrokes don't give your fingers enough practice to remember them without help. 
The second imperative is to use mnemonic structure to organize the chords memorably. 
<br><br>
It makes little sense to copy someone else's mappings verbatim, but do copy their ideas, there are some <a href="http://forum.tekgear.com/t/backspice-layout-config-fw-0-09/45http://forum.tekgear.com/t/backspice-layout-config-fw-0-09/45">good ones</a> out there. 
Leave the fastest chords and most frequent keystrokes free though, and then use Twidlit to arrange them. 

<h3>Putting it together</h3>
Using <em>File > <a href='ref.html#map'>Create Map File</a></em> you can select a hand-coded mnemonic <a href="syn.html#cfg"><tt>cfg.chords</tt></a> file of less frequent chords, a <a href="syn.html#timed"><tt>timed.chords</tt></a> file of chords sorted by speed, and a <a href="syn.html#ccount"><tt>count.keys</tt></a> file of keystrokes sorted by frequency, and combine them into a new <tt>cfg.chords</tt> file. 
<br><br>
<em>File > <a href='ref.html#assess'>Assess Map File</a></em> allows you to easily find the mappings in a cfg file that are far enough from the ideal to be worth reconsidering. 

<h3>Chord Space Mining</h3>
There are 255 chords, but what patterns connect them? 
Chord patterns are a primary resource for devising mnemonics, but they are strongly interconnected. 
As you develop a mapping and chords get used up, only some of the chords for a given pattern will still be available. 
<br><br>
How useful it would be to have a tool that lists the remaining available chords by pattern. 
It would then be much easier to find the pattern that best matches a group of keystrokes needing allocation. 
<em>File > <a href='ref.html#group'>Group Chords</a></em> is such a tool. 

<a name='learn'>
<h2>Learning the mapping</h2>
Put a few (maybe three) of the most frequent keystrokes in a <a href="syn.html#practice">practice <tt>keys</tt></a> file, and select it with <em><a href='ref.html#tutor'>Tutor</a> > Keystrokes</em>. 
The <a href="ref.html#text">Text pane</a> will prompt you with the keystroke(s), and if you can't remember the chord the <a href="ref.html#twiddler">Twiddler window</a> will show it to you after a <a href="ref.html#wait">delay</a>. 
<br><br>
This is learning, not practice for speed. 
Start small and don't rush. 
Your fingers will learn whatever mapping you press, even if it is wrong, so be sure to keep getting it right every time. 
<br><br>
Wait till you are confident before adding a couple more keystrokes, and leave the timer off till you are fully fluent. 
If you feel the need for speed then go back to polishing your random chording.
