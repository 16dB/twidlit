# A list of the key-strokes that never reach an application.
# Twidlit therefore can't use them. They vary with the OS.
#
# Entries are of the form:
# <modifier> <key code>
#
# A single digit is used for the modifier as the side of the
# keyboard it comes from is irrelevant. 
# Key code and modifier names are in TwidlitKeyNames.txt.
